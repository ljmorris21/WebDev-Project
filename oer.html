            <h2>What is Open Access for Library & Information Professionals?</h2>
            <p>This selected topic course focused on the concept of Open Access, which refer to the free online availability of research articles.<br /><br />
            This class explored the concept of Open Access, the  Open Access movement, examined best practices for library services, and developed strategies to prepare for the future. It culminated in a final project in which each class member creater an OER - an Open Education Resource - with a corresponding website. For my project, I created an short exlainer on using 3D printing in educational spaces, as well as a 3D printable "zine" - each "page" of which was licensed under the creative commons attribution license - that could be scanned with an augmented reality app to be shown a video detailing one of the steps in the 3D printing process. </p></section>

            <h2> What was the purpose of this project?</h2>
            <p>The purpose of this project was to create an open, printable 3D resource for the UNC BeAM Makerspaces to use for their 3D printers. My idea was that due to makerspace users only having to do one training to use a 3D printer, and perhaps having to rarely use 3D printing resources, they may need quick and accesible guidance on how to complete one or all of the steps of 3D printing with the makerspace resources.<br /><br /> By allowing users to refresh their memory simply and through taking out their phones and scanning one of the zine pages, which would hopefulyl be located near the printers, conveniently hanging on the rack on an O-ring, each video can give the user visual as well as audio instructions on how to proceed with whatever step they need help with, instead of having to rely only on writte, printed instructions.</p>
